			I am in my final year @ UBC pursuing a degree in Applied Biology & Computer Science. I find
			lots of joy and fulfillment from building things from the ground up, and seeing my ideas piece
			together. I believe that the pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and I am committed to
			continuously learning and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in my field.<br
			/><br />

			I pride myself in being a great team member. I bring a combination of technical skills,
			adaptability, and a strong work ethic to every project I undertake. I thrive in collaborative
			environments where ideas are freely exchanged, and I actively seek opportunities to contribute
			my expertise while learning from others.<br /><br />

			Currently, I am a Software Developer Intern at ResponsiveAds Inc.<br /><br />

			Feel free to contact me at any of my socials; Iâ€™d love to chat!
